Simple Angular/Spring Boot CRUD app
This is a simple CRUD app that takes advantage of the Spring Boot REST API, managed with `@ResponseBody` annotation,
The app needs an SQL database named "Projectsdb" with a table named "pojects_table", for there is a dummy file in the repo to mock real data.
While the back end must be run using Spring Boot maven commands `mvn spring-boot:run`,  the front end must be run using the Anguar CLI `ng serve` command.
Any feed back is much appreciated

NOTICE : Exception Handling was INTENTIONALLY omitted, it will be resolved after.
