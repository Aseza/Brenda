Simple Angular/Spring Boot CRUD app.

This is a simple CRUD app with real time functionnalities to demonstrate the use ofWebsockets with JMS on a full working backend project, it takes advantage of the Spring Boot REST API, managed with `@ResponseBody` annotation.
The Front was coded using Angular 4 while benefiting from Observables and STOMP over Websockets as well.
The app needs an SQL database named "Projectsdb" with a table named "pojects_table", for there is a dummy file in the repo to mock real data.
Any feed back is much appreciated
