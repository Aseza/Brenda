Simple Angular/Spring Boot CRUD app
This is a simple CRUD app that takes advantage of a REST API created with Spring boot,
The app needs and SQL database named "Projectsdb" with a table named "pojects-table", there is a dummy file in the repo to mock real data.
Then the back end must be run using Spring Boot maven commands `mvn spring-boot:run`. the front end must be run using `ng serve` command.
Any feed back is much appreciated

NOTICE : Exception Handling was INTENTIONALLY omitted, it will be resolved after.
